<h3>Electric Energy</h3>

<p>
  We can define electrical energy as the <br />
  energy generated by the movement of electrons<br />
  from one point to another. The movement of <br />
  charged particles along/through a medium <br />
  (say wire)constitute current or electricity.

<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>
  A scatterplot or scatterplot or ball graph bubble chart <br />
  is a type of mathematical diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates <br />
  to display the values ​​of two variables for a data set.
</p>

<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable <br />
  based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is
  called <br />
  the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other
  variable's value <br />
  is called the independent variable.
</p>

<h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished
  <br />
  at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example,
  <br />
  are such sources that are constantly being replenished.<br />
  Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.
