<h3>Electric Energy</h3>

<p>
  We can define electrical energy as the <br />
  energy generated by the movement of electrons<br />
  from one point to another. The movement of <br />
  charged particles along/through a medium <br />
  (say wire)constitute current or electricity.

<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>
  A scatterplot (AKA scatter chart, scatter graph)<br />
  uses dots to represent values for two different<br />
  numeric variables. The position of eache dot<br />
  on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates<br />
  values for an individual data point. Scatter plots<br />
  are used to to observe relationship between variables<br />
  <br />
</p>

<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the<br />
  value of a variable based on the value of another variable.<br />
  The variable you want to predict is called:<br />
  the dependent variable. <br />
  The variable you are using to predict the other<br />
  variable's value is called:<br />
  the independent variable.
</p>

<h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources<br />
  that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. <br />
  Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that<br />
  are constantly being replenished.<br />
  Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.
